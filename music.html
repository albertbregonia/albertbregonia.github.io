        <h2>Music Production</h2>
        One of my favorite things in life is music. Besides listening to music, I also produce my own instrumentals, write songs, rap and sing.<br />
        Ever since I was young I was always surrounded by music. My dad always sung karaoke brought that portion of Filipino culture into my life.<br />
        I use FL Studio 20 and have been making instrumentals and songs since 2018 as just a hobby.
